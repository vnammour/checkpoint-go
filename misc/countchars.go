Go Programming Language, 4.3 Maps
Hereâ€™s another example of maps in action, a program that counts the occurrences of each distinct Unicode code point
in its input. Since there are a large number of possible characters, only a small fraction of which would appear in
any particular document, a map is a natural way to keep track of just the ones that have been seen and their
corresponding counts.
